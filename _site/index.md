# About Me
<img alt="me" src="assets/images/me.jpeg" class="pull-left">
I've been programming professionally since 1999. Just about all of this
time has been spent developing for the web. Back in my early days I was 
using Linux/Apache/MySQL/Perl. Then it was on to SQL Server, C# ASP.Net 
(WebForms first then MVC later) and currently SPA's using various 
frameworks and a lot of JavaScript/TypeScript. 

In my spare time, I like to dabble with whatever catches my eye. 
Lately I've been playing around with Aurelia, Angular 2, and 
Electron. All using TypeScript, which I have come to love.
