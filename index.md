I've been programming professionally since 1999. Most of this
time has been spent developing for the web. In my early days I was
using Linux/Apache/MySQL/Perl. Later I moved on to
SQL Server, C# ASP.Net (WebForms first then MVC later),
SPA's using various frameworks and a lot of JavaScript/TypeScript/NodeJS.
Currently working mostly in the backend using Python.
